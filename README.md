## Mission Statement

We empower people with lived experience of online abuse to leverage AI and Web 3 tools to actively govern and create safer spaces for all.

## What are we hoping to achieve with this project?

1. Citizen owned and governed AI
2. Web3 tools for democratisation of ownership and governance
3. Incorporating “lived experience” for inclusivity, bias reduction, and for designing resilient systems.

## Why is this tool unique?

Step 1. Self-reporting

Players who experience hate speech have the option to report it.

Step 2. Subjective vs imperfectly-objective

Reports are checked by an AI agent who classifies them as hate speech or not (wrt to some protected characteristic). Players get LE (lived experience) points if those two agree.

Step 3. Challenging the imperfectly-objective

Players can challenge the AI agent result. Currently the only case when the challenge can happen is if the player believes that the model needs to consider a new protected characteristic. The player can submit a proposal to add that new characteristic to the set used by the model in the definition of hate speech.

Step 4. Subjective experience vs community values.

The community votes on the proposal to add new protected characteristic. This closes the subjective vs objective cycle, as the individual knows how it felt to be targeted by hate speech, but the community as a whole decides on what are the values that the community want to live by.
